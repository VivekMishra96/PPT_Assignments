    "**Q-4**. A group of 20 friends decide to play a game in which they each write a number between 1 and 20 on a slip of paper and put it into a hat. They then draw one slip of paper at random. What is the probability that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square (i.e., 1, 4, 9, or 16)? To calculate the probability that the number drawn from the hat is a perfect square (i.e., 1, 4, 9, or 16) out of the numbers 1 to 20, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes (perfect squares) and the total number of possible outcomes.\n",

    "Number of favorable outcomes: 4 (1, 4, 9, 16) Total number of possible outcomes: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n",

    "Therefore, the probability that the number drawn from the hat is a perfect square is 1/5 or 0.2.\n",

    "In Python, you can calculate and verify this probability using the following code:"
